❗️For issue disclosure, check out [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) ❗️

**Source** is a decentralized, permissionless, and censorship resistant layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain built in the [Cosmos Zone](https://cosmos.network/) ecosystem.

**Tokenomics**

⚪️ **Ticker**: SOURCE

⚪️ **Decimals**: 6

⚪️ **Unit**: uSource

⚪️ **Supply**: TBD

⚪️ **Rewards**: Fixed yearly reward schedule

✅ Circulating supply at genesis TBD $SOURCE (TBD)

✅ Max supply (After year 12): TBD $SOURCE (TBD)

After year 12 the inflation reward schedule ends.
Network incentives would primarily come from smart contract usage and regular tx fees generated on the network.

**Source** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Ignite (formerly Tendermint) and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).

## Get started

Click [Here](https://github.com/Source-Protocol-Cosmos/testnets) to run a node and to connect to the Source Testnet.

Alternatively,

If you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, then you can run a **local node** with a single command.

We recommend that you easily run your own hermes relayer to verify ibc transactions. You only need to add your mnemonic in [mnemonic](./hermes/mnemonic) file

```bash
# Set environments with mnemonic to run hermes
cp hermes/.env.example hermes/.env
echo "<YOUR MNENOMIC>" > hermes/mnemonic

# Start docker with node and hermes
bash ./run_full_node.sh
```

You can also skip hermes and run just the node

```bash
# Start docker with node
bash ./run_validator_only.sh
```
